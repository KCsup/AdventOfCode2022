# AdventOfCode2022
My repo for 2022's Advent of Code.

This year I'm going to be switching the language used every few days. Here's the order for the languages:
```
1: TypeScript
2-3: Haskell
4-6: Scala
7-9: Kotlin
10-12: Rust
13-15: Bash
16-18: Swift
19-21: BASIC
22-24: Obj-C
25: Holy C
```
I'm doing this challenge alongside @pantaelaman and @Bagel03
